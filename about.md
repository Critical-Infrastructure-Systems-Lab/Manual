## About the CIS Lab

As mentioned on the [CIS Lab Website](https://galelli.cee.cornell.edu), we are a team of scientists and engineers working on the interaction between critical infrastructures and the natural environment. We characterize climate risk on interconnected infrastructure systems and provide adaptive, robust, and scalable management solutions that balance reliability, resilience, and sustainability. We combine and leverage elements of process-based modelling, climatology, statistical learning, control theory, and optimization. Our group was established in 2013 by Dr. Stefano Galelli, when he joined the Singapore University of Technology and Design. We recently moved to Cornell University, so we now have roots in both North America and Southeast Asia.
