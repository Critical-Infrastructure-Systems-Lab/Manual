## About the CIS Lab

As mentioned on the [CIS Lab Website](https://galelli.cee.cornell.edu), **we are** a team of scientists and engineers working on the interaction between critical infrastructures and the natural environment. **We characterize** climate risk on interconnected infrastructure systems and provide adaptive, robust, and scalable management solutions that balance reliability, resilience, and sustainability. **We combine** and leverage elements of process-based modelling, climatology, statistical learning, control theory, and optimization. Our group was established in 2013 by Dr. Stefano Galelli, when he joined the Singapore University of Technology and Design. We recently moved to Cornell University, so we now have roots in both North America and Southeast Asia.

## Our values

There are a few important values on which our team builds. In particular, we believe in:

- A respectful, constructive, and pleasant working environment, in which everybody feels welcome and nurtured.

- Academic work-life balance. All stages of academic life can be challenging; we follow [these rules](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8282063/) to guide us through our daily life. 

- Science, engineering, and research as a means to improve the quality of life on this planet--as well as our knowledge.

- [Slow Science](https://compsci.science/slowscience), an expression intended to emphasize the need for solid and needed research, as opposed to sloppy and incremental work needed to increase somebody's H-index. If you want to know more about this, check ["Science in the age of selfies"](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1609793113) by Donald and Stuart Geman. 

- Open-source software. 

- Reproducible research.
