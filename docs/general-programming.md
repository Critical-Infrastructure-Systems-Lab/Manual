# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. It is widely used for blogging, including our own Lab manual! You can use Markdown for many other things, such as creating slides and other types of presentation material ([example](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html)).

## To do list

- Go through [this guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) that will introduce you to Markdown. If you want to practice your Markdown skills, consider writing a post or webpage for this manual!


# GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. It uses [Git](https://www.git-scm.com) software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. It is commonly used to host **open-source software** development.

Our team relies heavily on GitHub, and all our software projects are hosted on the [CIS Lab GitHub page](https://github.com/Critical-Infrastructure-Systems-Lab)--including the group manual. The expectation is that, over time, you will become a GitHub proficient user.

## To do list

- Open an account on [GitHub](https://github.com).

- Ask [Stefano](emailto:galelli@cornell.edu) to give you access to the [CIS Lab GitHub page](https://github.com/Critical-Infrastructure-Systems-Lab).

- Take the [online training](https://skills.github.com) provided on GitHub website. We recommend proceeding as follows:
  - Start with **Introduction to GitHub**
  - Take all modules on **First day on GitHub**
  - Take all modules on **First week on GitHub** (*Code with Codespaces* and *Code with Copilot* are optional)

 
# Linux for research

[GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) is the powerhouse (operating system) behind most of our research group's computing clusters. Mastering the command line is required for running computational experiments. If you want a deep drive into Linux, then check our blog post [here](https://critical-infrastructure-systems-lab.github.io/manual/programming/2024-07-10-tutorial-linux-1/).

## To do list (Getting started with Hopper)

- Submit the [request form](https://www.cac.cornell.edu/services/external/RequestCACid.aspx?ProjectID=vs498_0001) to Cornell Center for Advanced Computing (CAC). Also email Professor Vivek Srikrishnan to ask for his approval of the request.
- While waiting for the approval, read and understand this [guide](https://github.com/Cornell-EWRS/hopper) to get started with Hopper.


# Python coding standard
When working on a long-term collaboration project with others, adopting a consistent coding standard is key. This practice not only improves the readability and maintainability of the codebase, saving you from future headaches, but also develops industry-valued skills.

## To do list

- Familiarize yourself with the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). While the choice of a specific style guide is subjective, Google Python Style Guide offers a comprehensive set of common rules along with clear explanations and examples.
- Streamline your coding workflow by configuring [your favourite IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/formatting) to automatically format your code with tools, such as [Black](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/auto-format-your-python-code-with-black/).
