# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. It is widely used for blogging, including our own Lab manual! You can use Markdown for many other things, such as creating slides and other types of presentation material ([example](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html)).

## To do list

- Go through [this guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) that will introduce you to Markdown. If you want to practice your Markdown skills, consider writing a post or webpage for this manual!


# GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. It uses [Git](https://www.git-scm.com) software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. It is commonly used to host **open-source software** development.

Our team relies heavily on GitHub, and all our software projects are hosted on the [CIS Lab GitHub page](https://github.com/Critical-Infrastructure-Systems-Lab)--including the group manual. The expectation is that, over time, you will become a GitHub proficient user.

## To do list

- Open an account on [GitHub](https://github.com).

- Ask [Stefano](emailto:galelli@cornell.edu) to give you access to the [CIS Lab GitHub page](https://github.com/Critical-Infrastructure-Systems-Lab).

- Take the [online training](https://skills.github.com) provided on GitHub website. We recommend proceeding as follows:
  - Start with **Introduction to GitHub**
  - Take all modules on **First day on GitHub**
  - Take all modules on **First week on GitHub** (*Code with Codespaces* and *Code with Copilot* are optional)
