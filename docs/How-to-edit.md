This manual is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com), a feature of GitHub that allows us to host a static website from a public repository. This means that:

- Anybody can look at the material we create
- **Anybody within the CIS Lab can contribute to the manual!**

GitHub pages uses [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll#), a static site generator that takes Markdown and HTML files and creates a complete static website based on your choice of layouts. Among the several Jekyll themes available, **we chose [Hydejack](https://hydejack.com/) for our Lab manual**. Hydejack is not only very visually appealing, but it also provides many relevant features, such as [blogging](https://hydejack.com/blog/) or [writing math](https://hydejack.com/docs/writing/#adding-math).


## Before moving forward

As explained above, this manual builds on GitHub, GitHub pages, Markdown, and Hydejack. You will thus need a basic level of familiarity with these tools before you can start contributing to the manual. Your **To do list**:

- Familiarize with [Markdown](https://critical-infrastructure-systems-lab.github.io/manual/docs/general-programming) 
- Take the introductory course to [GitHub](https://critical-infrastructure-systems-lab.github.io/manual/docs/general-programming). Note that the specific training we recommend includes a specific [section](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) on GitHub Pages.
- Take a quick look at the Hydejack [documentation](https://hydejack.com/docs/). More details on the specific elements you should be familiar with are reported below.
- Ask [Stefano](emailto:galelli@cornell.edu) for access to the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/Critical-Infrastructure-Systems-Lab/manual) containing this website.




Since the manual has already been setup, the key sections you will need are [Config](https://hydejack.com/docs/config/), [Basics](https://hydejack.com/docs/basics/), and [Writing](https://hydejack.com/docs/writing/)
