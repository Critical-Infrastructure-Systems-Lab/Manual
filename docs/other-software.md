# Multi-site and distributed Stochastic weather generators

* [IBMWeatherGen](https://github.com/IBM/IBMWeatherGen), gridded, multisite, multivariate, and daily stochastic weather generator based on resampling methodology written in Python.
* [Stochastic Weather Generator v2.0](https://github.com/nassernajibi/WGEN-v2.0), weather-regime based stochastic weather generator.
* [RWGEN](https://github.com/rwgen1/rwgen?tab=readme-ov-file), stochastic spatiotemporal Rainfall and Weather GENerator built around the Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulse (NSRP) rainfall model.
* [AWE-GEN-2D](https://hyd.ifu.ethz.ch/research-data-models/awe-gen-2d.html), a stochastic weather generator that simulates gridded climate variables at high spatial and temporal resolution for present and future climates.
* [wxgen](https://github.com/metno/wxgen?tab=readme-ov-file), a command-line tool for generating arbitrarily long weather time-series. The generator produces gridded output for multiple variables (e.g. temperature, precipitation) and aims to have realistic covariances in space, time, and across variables.
* [BNWeatherGen](https://github.com/MNLR/BNWeatherGen?tab=readme-ov-file)
* [Gridwegen](https://github.com/tanerumit/gridwegen?tab=readme-ov-file) (repo not currently maintained)
