| [Macro-Energy Systems: Toward a New Discipline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435119303617) | Levi et al. (2019) | Introduction | Defines macro-energy systems modeling | 1 |
| [Leveraging open-source tools for collaborative macro-energy system modeling efforts](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2020.11.002) | DeCarolis et al. (2020) | Introduction | Answers to why we need the open-source approach to energy systems modeling | 11 |
| [Power sector modeling 101](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2016/02/f30/EPSA_Power_Sector_Modeling_FINAL_021816_0.pdf) | Boyd (2016) | Introduction | Introduces different types of power system models | 2 |
| [Trends in tools and approaches for modelling the energy transition](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116731) | Chang et al. (2021) | Introduction | Surveys research areas in using energy systems model along with different tools in the market. It also discusses model coupling | 8 |
| [The gap between energy policy challenges and model capabilities](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.10.033) | Savvidis et al. (2019) | Introduction | Maps policy-relevant questions to modeling tools | 7 |
| [Core process representation in power system operational models: Gaps, challenges, and opportunities for multisector dynamics research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.122049) | Oikonomou et al. (2022) | Technical | Introduces and reviews production cost models | 3 |
| [Linopy: Linear optimization with n-dimensional labeled variables](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04823) | Hofmann (2023) | Technical | Shortly describes optimization modeling frameworks and solvers | 5 |
